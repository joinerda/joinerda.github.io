The Unity Visualization Toolkit is a collection of tools for performing 3D visualization in a Unity scene.

It includes data structures for structured (gridded) data, unstructured (point) data, and molecular data, as well as a number of visualization objects that can be linked to the data structures to produce isocontour, threshold, volumetric, glyph, and quiver plots.

For this first introduction, we will start with loading a CSV (comma separated value) file into a UVT scene, and creating a glyphset based on the values loaded.
