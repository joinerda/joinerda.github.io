This is a departure from the current set of posts on adding modeling and simulation to Unity game engine.
In Unity, I've got great built in animation and visualization and have to add my own numerical analysis.
In my Intro to Scientific Programming class (first year Java for computational science majors) I have
the opposite problem, good tools for handling the math, but not as many options as I'd like for visualization.

There are some good viz tools in Java, but none of them had the ease of use of "plot and pause" in MATLAB,
or "plt.plot/plt.show" in python/matplotlib. I needed a simple to use plotting package for basic line plots, 
scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps for a first semester group of Java students who were focusing on
science applications. I wanted something that could be called in a couple of lines, didn't require knowledge
of exception handling or of swing components or the canvas drawing process in Java, and that could handle
either standard arrays or arraylist objects.

I ended up writing a small package, which can be downloaded from
[https://github.com/joinerda/worldofdata-javaplots](https://github.com/joinerda/worldofdata-javaplots).

This blog will assume you are creating a java project in eclipse, though the javaplots package will work
with or without an IDE. If you are working at a command line, you just need the worldofdata folder in the same files
as your java code, or you should be able to add it to any other IDE in whatever way you like to do to manage adding
packages to a java project.
